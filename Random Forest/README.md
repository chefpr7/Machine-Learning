# Credit-card-fraud-detection

The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:

1.Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.<br />
2.Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones.<br />
3.Data availability as the data is mostly private.

The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible. For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced. A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.

The file available above are the primary code files used to make the machine learning model.

Since the Dataset used in this project is very large in size. So I am providing the link to the entire dataset that I used so that you can download it for using it in your model.
